#   Problems

##  Users
1.  When editing a user on /users page, its current info loads, such as password, username, phone number and extension, except it's company and user role.✅
2.  Can't add new user because server expects user._id when sending request.✅ 
3.  And if i edit the user and try to save it, it creates a new user instead of editing the current user's info.✅
4.  Setting user role for user isn't setting it's userLevel value in the backend.✅
